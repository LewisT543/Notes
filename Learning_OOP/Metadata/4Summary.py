The concept of metaclasses looks hard at first glance, but if you’re responsible for API design or development, 
metaclasses are the magic that could help you in your work.

When you want to change your classes automatically, but decorators are not efficient, then metaclasses should help you.

In all other cases, you should agree with Tim Peters that you shouldn’t worry about metaclasses, because many problems 
can be solved in a simpler way than by using metaclasses.

But still, it’s beneficial to understand metaclasses in order to know when to employ them to solve a class type problem.
