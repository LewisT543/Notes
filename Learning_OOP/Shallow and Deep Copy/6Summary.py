                                #### SUMMARY ####

# The deepcopy() method creates and persists new instances of source objects, 
# whereas any shallow copy operation only stores references to the original memory address

# A deep copy operation takes significantly more time than any shallow copy operation

# The deepcopy() method copies the whole object, including all nested objects; itâ€™s an example of practical recursion taking place;
# deep copy might cause problems when there are cyclic references in the structure to be copied.
