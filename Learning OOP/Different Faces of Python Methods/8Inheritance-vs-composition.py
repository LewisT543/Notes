                                #### INHERITANCE VS COMPOSITION ####

### INHERITANCE
# Inheritance models what is called an 'IS A' relation.
# Examples:
    # a Laptop is a (specialized form of) Computer;
    # a Square is a (specialized form of) Figure;
    # a Hovercraft is a Vehicle.

# Following this, once you inherit a property from a superclass, the subclass will have this property too.
'''inheritance extends a class's capabilities by adding new components and modifying existing ones; in other words, 
the complete recipe is contained inside the class itself and all its ancestors; the object takes all the class's belongings 
and makes use of them'''

### COMPOSITION
# Composition models what is called a 'HAS A' relation.
# Examples:
    # a Laptop has a network card;
    # a Hovercraft has a specific engine.

# Composition is the process of composing an object using other different objects. The objects used in the composition deliver
# a set of desired traits (properties and/or methods) so we can say that they act like blocks used to build a more complicted structure.
'''composition projects a class as a container (called a composite) able to store and use other objects (derived from other classes) 
where each of the objects implements a part of a desired class's behavior. Itâ€™s worth mentioning that blocks are loosely coupled with 
the composite, and those blocks could be exchanged any time, even during program runtime.'''

# Basically we are able to have an object become part of another object. Accessible using: TopLevelClass.MidLevelClass.method().

# Another Example using both methods.
    # If a problem fits a 'IS A' relationship, use Inheritance.
    # If a problem fits a 'HAS A' relationship, use Composition
