# Python allows you to subclass any built-in class such as a list, tuple, dictionary, and many others;
# by subclassing the built-ins, you can easily adapt generics to provide more sophisticated features;
# by subclassing the built-ins, you can modify only the parts (methods, attributes) that you intend to modify, 
# while all remaining parts will behave as good old built-ins.
